# 🚍 Public Transport Tracking & Management System

## 📘 Overview

The **Public Transport Tracking & Management System** is a full-stack intelligent web platform designed to modernize and digitize public transportation operations.

It enables **real-time tracking of buses and vehicles**, **AI-driven ETA predictions**, **automated fare collection**, **route optimization**, and **citizen engagement** through an intuitive interface for passengers, drivers, and administrators.

This system aims to bring **transparency, efficiency, and convenience** to rural and urban transport authorities while leveraging **AI and cloud technologies** for scalability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide **real-time bus and route tracking** with accurate ETA predictions
- Enable **digital ticketing, payments, and booking** through a unified web interface
- Assist **transport authorities** in route planning, vehicle allocation, and analytics
- Improve **citizen convenience and safety** using location-aware systems
- Create a **sustainable and inclusive** transport ecosystem, scalable to rural regions

| **Ticket Booking & Payment** | Online ticket purchase, fare calculation, digital receipts, and payment gateway integration |
| **Driver Interface** | Web-based interface for drivers to mark attendance, update route status, and send live updates |
| **Admin Dashboard** | Centralized dashboard for managing routes, vehicles, analytics, and performance reports |
| **Analytics & Reports** | Predictive analytics for route demand, passenger density, and operational efficiency |
| **AI-Powered ETA Prediction** | Uses ML models to estimate arrival times based on traffic, weather, and distance |
| **Crowd Density Monitoring** | AI-based analysis for crowd estimation at bus stops (future-ready) |
| **Notification & Alerts** | SMS/email push alerts for route delays, cancellations, and upcoming buses |

---

## 💡 Novelty & Uniqueness

- **AI-driven predictive transport**: ETA and crowd models trained on local data
- **Offline-first capability**: Works seamlessly in low-connectivity areas
- **Multi-role system**: Unified platform for commuters, drivers, and administrators
- **Eco & rural-ready**: Designed to work in low-resource environments
- **Anomaly detection**: Identifies irregular routes or delays automatically
- **Web-based simplicity**: No app installation required, accessible from any device

---

## 🔍 Difference from Existing Systems

| **Old System** | **New System (Proposed)** |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Manual scheduling and no real-time visibility | Real-time GPS tracking and live route maps |
| Physical tickets and manual fare collection | Digital ticket booking and contactless payments |
| Poor communication between driver and passengers | Instant alerts, route changes, and delay notifications |
| No analytics for route optimization | AI-driven analytics and route efficiency reports |
| Urban-centric solutions only | Designed to work in **rural and low-network regions** |

---
