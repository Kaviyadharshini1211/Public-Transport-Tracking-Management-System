🚍 Public Transport Tracking & AI Fleet Management System — Final Implementation List
1. Real-Time Vehicle Tracking

Live GPS tracking for all buses using driver-side location updates.

Route mapping with continuous position updates on the commuter and admin dashboards.

Last-known-location storage for low-connectivity areas.

2. AI-Driven ETA Prediction

Machine learning models (LightGBM, XGBoost, LSTM, TCN) to predict bus arrival times.

ETA adjustments based on traffic patterns, speed variations, failed stops, and historical behavior.

ETA delivery through web, SMS, and optional IVR for rural areas.

3. Intelligent Fleet Assignment

AI determines which routes are crowded using ticketing and historical demand data.

Automatic vehicle reallocation suggestions for peak hours, school timings, markets, and special events.

Dynamic route scheduling based on predicted demand.

4. Ticketing & Passenger Load Estimation

Digital ticket purchase & verification.

Occupancy estimation based on live ticket sales (no hardware sensors required).

Boarding trends detection for high-traffic routes.

5. Multi-Channel Passenger Information System

Web portal for urban smartphone users.

SMS-based ETA for rural users.

Optional IVR system for non-smartphone access.

Automatic delay, cancellation, and arrival alerts.

6. AI-Based Anomaly Detection

Detection of off-route driving, long stops, sudden slowdowns, and unusual operations.

Alerts sent to admin panel for intervention.

LSTM-Autoencoders + Isolation Forest for pattern analysis.

7. Admin Control & Monitoring Dashboard

Live fleet view: buses, routes, speed, delay status, crowd estimation.

Route creation, modification, schedule updates, and vehicle assignments.

Passenger analytics, demand heatmaps, and daily/weekly reports.

8. Route Optimization & Intelligent Dispatching

Classical graph algorithms (Dijkstra/A*) for shortest paths.

Reinforcement learning models (DQN/PPO) to recommend optimized dispatch strategies.

Automatic suggestion for increasing/decreasing fleet size per route.

9. Rural Connectivity + Offline Support

Reduced-data GPS transmissions for low-network zones.

Caching of ETA and last known bus location for offline display.

SMS fallback mode for critical updates.

MERN stack with microservices for AI modules.

JWT authentication + role-based access (Admin / Driver / Commuter).

Docker-based deployment for scalability across municipal servers.

13. Sustainability & Efficiency Insights

Fuel consumption estimation based on route delays and load.

Emission reduction indicators and green-route suggestions.

Reports to help authorities build cleaner, efficient mobility systems.
